<h1>Online fraud</h1>
<p>“The Internet has become one of the most popular tools used to commit fraud and criminals are becoming more and more sophisticated with their hacking techniques,” said Kathy Koestner,
 Vice President of Information Security. “As a result, it’s extremely important for consumers to use only trusted secured wireless networks when completing their financial transactions 
and understand all personal information shared online can be used by fraudsters to commit online fraud.”</p><br>

<p>Keep your computers and mobile devices up to date. Having the latest security software, web browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online
threats. Turn on automatic updates so you receive the newest fixes as they become available.</p><br>
<p>Set strong passwords. A strong password is at least eight characters in length and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>


<p>privacy settings and avoid posting things like birthdays, addresses, mother’s maiden name, etc. Be wary of requests to connect from people you do not know.
Secure your internet connection. Always protect your home wireless network with a password. When connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, be cautious about what information you are sending
over it.</p><br>

<p>Shop safely. Before shopping online, make sure the website uses secure technology. When you are at the checkout screen, verify that the web address begins with https. Also, check to see 
if a tiny locked padlock symbol appears on the page.</p><br>

<p>Read the site’s privacy policies. Though long and complex, privacy policies tell you how the site protects the personal information it collects. If you don’t see or understand a site’s 
privacy policy, consider doing business elsewhere.</p>
<br>


<h1>1. Use Smart, Verified Apps Only</h1>

<p>Mobile apps are convenient for accessing a wide range of services. All apps, however, are not safe. As a result, be cautious about the apps you download to your phone and make sure they’re
legitimate. Established Fintech companies are devising countermeasures to avoid financial fraud in India via smartphone apps.</p><br>

<h1>2. Browse Secure and Authorized Websites Only</h1>

<p>Even if a website appears to be professional, it is best to avoid making online payments unless you are certain it is legitimate. Customers should avoid all non-secure websites and only 
visit those with “https://” in the URL preceding the “www” and domain name. Be wary of imposter websites with domain names that sound or spell similar to those of well-known brands.</p><br>

<h1>3. Use Secure Internet Connections</h1>

<p>Signing in to an unsecured public Wi-Fi connection can also be an issue, as it makes your phone vulnerable to cyber criminals on the prowl. To perpetrate fraud, they can track your 
activities and get access to your computer or smartphone. As a result, if you’re planning to make an online payment or share critical personal banking information, be sure you’re using a
secure private connection</p><br>

<h1>4. Be Vigilant When Using the Card</h1>

<p>When paying at a store, restaurant, or receiving home delivery, you should never take your card out of your sight. Check to see whether the card reader POS machine is legitimate or if 
it’s a card skimmer in disguise that captures all of your personal information in order to steal your money. Only choose the international transaction option while you’re outside of India,
as it eliminates the need for two-step verification.
Keep your security software, web browser, and operating system up to date on your computer and phone. When asked to choose a password, avoid easy-to-guess passwords and instead choose a 
strong one that includes upper and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Do not use the same password for all of your online accounts. Change your passwords frequently to 
avoid security lapses whenever you are dealing with critical transactions.</p><br>

<h1>6. Never Share Sensitive Personal Information</h1>

<p>Never give out your personal information to a stranger or a third party posing as a bank or financial institution representative over phone, SMS, or e-mail. Never send money without first
 verifying the identity of the person who is requesting for such information.</p><br>

<h1>7. Think twice before responding to suspicious Calls, SMS or E-mails</h1>

<p>We have all been on the receiving end of phishing e-mails, texts, and phone calls attempting to extract information from us. Fraudulent callers may impersonate a bank or financial 
institution employee and seek for personal information. Fraudsters pretend to be calling from reputed financial institutions and use alleging reasons such as card or service expiration, 
unused reward points, free cashback, and so on to fool you into sharing financial and personal information. They will utilise your personal bank information to withdraw money from your 
account without your awareness once they have it. The scammer may impersonate a someone you know or a friend and beg you to send money right away, citing an “emergency.” Do not respond to
such kind of messages.</p><br>

<h1>8. Responding to calls asking ‘Remote Access to Your Computer’ is a big NO NO</h1>

<p>Anyone attempting to acquire remote access to your personal computer, unless you have engaged an IT company to repair your home computer, is almost certainly a scammer.
Scammers generally use excuses of updating a software or anti-virus to obtain access to your computer, then lock it down and demand a ransom to free it for you, and it might not even stop
there. Once you’ve given them your payment information, they’re free to do anything they want with it. The greatest thing you can do in response to any request for remote access to your 
computer is to hang up without saying anything.</p><br>

<h1>9. Don’t Bite the Bait<h1>

<p>Before you click on any link, image, or attachment that has been sent to you, consider whether it is relevant to you or if it was delivered in response to your request or application. 
The majority of the time, communications from unknown contacts are fake. They entice you to click on those links so they may steal your information and use it to transfer money to their
 accounts. Other sorts of bait include getting “randomly” chosen for a reward in a contest you
 didn’t even enter, or appealing internet offers that seem too good to be true.</p><br>
