<h1>What is cyber Crime</h1>
<p>cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network.
While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them.
 Others use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes do both ie.target computers to infect them with a computer 
virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networks.
Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a networked device. Most cybercrime is committed by cybercriminals or hackers who want to 
make money. However, occasionally cybercrime aims to damage computers or networks for reasons other than profit. These could be political or personal.
Cybercrime can be carried out by individuals or organizations. Some cybercriminals are organized, use advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled. Others are novice hackers.</p><br>


<h1>What are the types of cybercrime?</h1>

<p>Email and internet fraud.
Identity fraud (where personal information is stolen and used).
Theft of financial or card payment data.
Theft and sale of corporate data.
Cyberextortion (demanding money to prevent a threatened attack).
Ransomware attacks (a type of cyberextortion).
Cryptojacking (where hackers mine cryptocurrency using resources they do not own).
Cyberespionage (where hackers access government or company data).
Interfering with systems in a way that compromises a network.
Infringing copyright.
Illegal gambling.
Selling illegal items online.
Soliciting, producing, or possessing child pornography.</p><br>


<h1><b>Examples of different types of cybercrime attack used by cybercriminals</b></h1>
<br>
<p><b>1.Malware attacks</b></p>
<p>A malware attack is where a computer system or network is infected with a computer virus or other type of malware. A computer compromised by malware could be used by cybercriminals 
for several purposes. These include stealing confidential data, using the computer to carry out other criminal acts, or causing damage to data.
A famous example of a malware attack was the WannaCry ransomware attack, a global cybercrime committed in May 2017. WannaCry is a type of ransomware, malware used to extort money by
holding the victim’s data or device to ransom. The ransomware targeted a vulnerability in computers running Microsoft Windows.</p><br>

<p><b>2.Phishing</b></p>
<p>A phishing campaign is when spam emails, or other forms of communication, are sent with the intention of tricking recipients into doing something that undermines their security. 
Phishing campaign messages may contain infected attachments or links to malicious sites, or they may ask the receiver to respond with confidential information.
A famous example of a phishing scam took place during the World Cup in 2018. According to our report, 2018 Fraud World Cup , the World Cup phishing scam involved emails that were sent to
 football fans. These spam emails tried to entice fans with ake free trips to Moscow, where the World Cup was being hosted. People who opened and clicked on the links contained in these 
emails had their personal data stolen. 
Another type of phishing campaign is known as spear-phishing. These are targeted phishing campaigns which try to trick specific individuals into jeopardizing the security of the 
organization they work for. 
Unlike mass phishing campaigns, which are very general in style, spear-phishing messages are typically crafted to look like messages from a trusted source. For example, they are made to 
look like they have come from the CEO or the IT manager. They may not contain any visual clues that they are fake.</p><br>

<h1>3.Distributed DoS attacks</h1>
<p>Distributed DoS attacks (DDoS) are/ a type of cybercrime attack that cybercriminals use to bring down a system or network. Sometimes connected IoT (Internet of Things) devices are used to 
launch DDoS attacks.
A DDoS attack overwhelms a system by using one of the standard communication protocols it uses to spam the system with connection requests. Cybercriminals who are carrying out 
cyberextortion may use the threat of a DDoS attack to demand money. Alternatively, a DDoS may be used as a distraction tactic while another type of cybercrime takes place.
A famous example of this type of attack is the 2017 DDoS attack on the UK National Lottery website. This brought the lottery’s website and mobile app offline, preventing UK citizens 
from playing. The reason behind the attack remains unknown, however, it is suspected that the attack was an attempt to blackmail the National Lottery.</p><br>


<h1>Types of cyber threats</h1>

<p>1. Cybercrime includes single actors or groups targeting systems for financial gain or to cause disruption.<br>

2. Cyber-attack often involves politically motivated information gathering.<br>

3. Cyberterrorism is intended to undermine electronic systems to cause panic or fear.</p><br>

<h1>How to prevent cybercrime</h1>
<p>While it may not be possible to completely eradicate cybercrime and ensure complete internet security, businesses can reduce their exposure to it by maintaining an effective 
cybersecurity strategy using a defense-in-depth approach to securing systems, networks and data.

Cybercrime risks can be reduced with the following steps:<br><br>

1.develop clear policies and procedures for the business and employees;<br>
2.create cybersecurity incident response plans to support these policies and procedures;<br>
3.outline the security measures that are in place about how to protect systems and corporate data;<br>
4.use two-factor authentication (2FA) apps or physical security keys;<br>
5.activate 2FA on every online account when possible;<br>
6.verbally verify the authenticity of requests to send money by talking to a financial manager;<br>
7.create intrusion detection system (IDS) rules that flag emails with extensions similar to company emails;<br>
8.carefully scrutinize all email requests for transfer of funds to determine if the requests are out of the ordinary;<br>
9.continually train employees on cybersecurity policies and procedures and what to do in the event of security breaches;<br>
10.keep websites, endpoint devices and systems current with all software release updates or patches;<br>
11.back up data and information regularly to reduce the damage in case of a ransomware attack or data breach.</p><br>
