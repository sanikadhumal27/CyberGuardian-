<h1>1. Secure your Facebook account with a strong password and two-factor authentication</h1>
<p>Pick a strong and unique password. Avoid including your name, phone number, email address or common words. Don't reuse your Facebook password on other services online, and never share your
password with others.To further secure your account, we recommend enabling two-factor authentication, both for yourself and as a requirement for other members of your business. 
Once you've set up this extra layer of protection, we'll ask you to enter a code or confirm your login attempt each time someone tries accessing your Facebook account from a computer or
mobile device we don't recognize. We also encourage you to sign up to get alerts when someone attempts to log in from a device we don't recognize.visit the Help Center to learn more about
 how to set up and manage two-factor authentication and receive alerts about unrecognized logins.</p><br>

<h1>2. Review Page roles and permissions</h1>
<p>Be sure to familiarize yourself with the different Page roles that exist and the permissions they have. We recommend regularly reviewing who has admin access to your Page in settings, 
and when you add your Page to a Business Manager, please take a moment to understand the permissions you allow. We also recommend having more than one admin for your Page, so that in 
case you ever lose access to your Page, someone you trust can help keep the Page up and running, and get you back in.</p><br>

<h1>3. Don't accept friend requests from people you don't know</h1>
<p>Scammers may create fake accounts in an attempt to friend and manipulate people. Accepting requests from scammers could lead to spam being posted on your timeline and shared with your 
friends. Scammers may also tag you in posts and send malicious messages to you and your contacts, so we encourage you to be careful to only accept friend requests from people you know 
and trust. Similarly, don't grant Business Manager permission to Pages you don't know. You can report suspicious Business Manager permission requests here.</p><br>


<h1>4. Watch out for suspicious links and malicious software</h1>
<p>Keep an eye out for links you don't recognize, especially if they're coming from people you don't know or trust. Be careful not to click on suspicious links, open suspicious files or 
install malicious apps or browser extensionsâ€”even if they appear to come from a friend or a company you know. This includes links on Facebook, in private messages and in emails. Keep in 
mind that Facebook will never ask you for your password in an email. You can always confirm whether an email claiming to be from Facebook is authentic by reviewing recent emails we've 
sent in the Security and Login Settings here. If you see a post or message that tries to trick you into sharing personal information, please report it.

To avoid infecting your device or computer network, learn the signs of malicious software and ways you can protect your devices from it. And remember to keep your devices, web browsers
 and applications up to date and remove any suspicious applications or browser add-ons.</p><br>

<h1>5. Set up trusted contacts</h1>
<p>To help you regain access to your account, and then your Page, in case you are ever locked out, you can enable your friends to be your trusted contacts. 
(Update on August 2, 2022 at 11:00AM PT: The trusted contacts feature is no longer available.) They'll be able to send you a recovery code with a URL to help you get back into your 
account.
Lastly, if you think your personal account has been compromised in any way, please visit facebook.com/hacked to get help, and visit our Help Center for help with your Page security. 
You can also explore Privacy Basics for more ways to increase your account security and to learn about the protections we have in place.
Don't Upload All Your Information
Facebook has a dedicated section where users can add personal information, education, and work details. But is adding that info really necessary? Do Facebook and other users need to know 
where you went to middle school?
It might seem intriguing to enter everything, but users do not need to upload all their personal information. You should only add the necessary information, like your name, city, and
recent profile picture.
Facebook allows its users to add a status update with the location. If you wish to keep your whereabouts private, avoid uploading that for the general public.</p><br>

<h1>6. Customize Your Post Privacy</h1>
<p>Customizing post privacy gives users complete control over how their Facebook profile looks. You can change your privacy even after the post is uploaded.

To change the privacy of your Facebook post:

Upload the status or media of your choice.
Tap the Visibility menu mentioned under your username.
Choose the desired audience. You can choose Friends, Friends except, Specific Friends, or Only Me from the available options.
Tap Done.
Post a Facebook Status
Facebook post audience
Facebook Stories also have the option to set your target audience. You should change your audience settings to Friends only or Selected friends. That way, no other users can see your

someone else is using your Facebook account.

<h1>9. Only Give Necessary Permissions to Facebook</h1>
<p>When you log into your Facebook account on a device, it requests permission to access your camera, location, and gallery. It helps Facebook collect data for marketing purposes.

Facebook tracks the data you upload, the ads you click, and your geographical location. Moreover, it also keeps tabs on the user's IP address, search history, and deleted content.

Access your phone's Settings.
Scroll down and tap Facebook.
Select Location and change the setting to Ask Next Time Or When I Share.
Tap Photos and change the permission from All Photos to Selected Photos.
Toggle off the Allow Tracking option.

Turn off Allow Tracking option
Choose Selected Photos option
Choose Ask Next Time Or When I Share option</p><br>

and settings to ensure your account is safe and secure.From the level of security to ad and data settings, this privacy checkup covers everything. Apart from this, the survey also
reviews your interactions and activities performed on your account. It is advisable to perform it at least once every month.
