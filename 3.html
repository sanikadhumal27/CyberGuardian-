<h1>section 65:Tampering With Computer Source Document</h1>
<p>Whoever knowingly or intentionally conceals, destroys or alters or intentionally or knowingly causes another to conceal, destroy or alter any computer source code used for a computer, 
computer programme, computer system or computer network, when the computer source code is required to be kept or maintained by law for the time being in force, shall be punishable with
imprisonment up to three years, or with fine which may extend up to two lakh rupees, or with both.

When the ingredients of the section are analysed it become clear how tomake out a case under this section? The culprit shall have mensria(knowingly or intentionally, and should ‘conceal’ 
meaning to hide or to take away from the view or steal, or ‘destroy’ meaning causing destruction or deletion, or ‘alter’ meaning to make changes, and thus the culprit with mensria shall 
conceal, destroy or alter any ‘computer source code’ then it is an offence under section 65 IT Act. Source code means‘the listing of programmes, computer commands, design and layout and
programme analysis of computer resource in any form’. There are many computer programming languages like C, C+, Java, .Net, ASP etc. A set of commands written by using one of these computer 
programming languages is computer source c.</p><br>

<h1>section 66:computer-related offences</h1>

<p>Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, of 2000 made it a punishable offence for any person to send offensive information using a computer or any other electronic device.
The provision also made it punishable for a person to send information that they believed to be false.
Section 66A had prescribed three years' imprisonment if a social media message caused "annoyance" or was found "grossly offensive".
Even sending emails for causing annoyance, inconvenience, or to deceive or mislead the recipient about the origin of the message was punishable under this section.
The court struck down the provision as unconstitutional and a violation of free speech in 2015 in the Shreya Singhal Case.
The section relating to restrictions on online speech was declared unconstitutional on grounds of violating the freedom of speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India.
It held that online intermediaries would only be obligated to take down content on receiving an order from a court or government authority.</p><br>


<h1>Section 67:It Act 2000 And It's Scope And Misuse To Violate Digital Freedom</h1>

<p>The Information Technology Act, 2000 (also known as ITA-2000, or the IT Act) is an Act of the Indian Parliament notified on 17th October, 2000. It is the primary law in India dealing with 
cybercrime and electronic commerce. One of the objectives of legislating the Information Technology Act, 2000 ("Act") was to discourage and punish crimes like voyeurism and digital 
obscenity although this Act has been a subject of contention and controversy. As it is amended, it contains some of the most stringent privacy requirements in the world and has the 
unfortunate impact of holding intermediaries liable for illegal content.
According to Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 whoever publishes or transmits or causes to be published or transmitted in the electronic form, any material which is 
lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or if its effect is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see 
or hear the matter contained or embodied in it, shall be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and with fine 
which may extend to five lakh rupees and in the event of second or subsequent conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years and also fine 
which may extend to ten lakh rupees.
There has been stark rise in cases of online harassment recently which has sprung questions on the viability of Section 67 of the IT Act. Nonetheless, Section 67 is the primary provision 
that is applied in maximum cases of cybercrimes against women along with Section 66 E.</p><br>
