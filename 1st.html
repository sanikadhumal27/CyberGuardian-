			<h1>What is cybersecurity awareness?</h1><br><br>
			<p>Cybersecurity awareness is an ongoing process of educating and training employees about the 
			threats that lurk in cyberspace, how to prevent such threats and what they must do in the event 
			of a security incident. It also helps to inculcate in them a sense of proactive responsibility for 
			keeping the company and its assets safe and secure. In simple terms,cybersecurity awareness is 
			knowing what security threats are and acting responsibly to avoid potential risks.<br>
			<br>
			Cybersecurity awareness includes being aware of the latest security threats, cybersecurity best
			practices,the dangers of clicking on a malicious link or downloading an infected attachment,
			interacting online, disclosing sensitive information and so on. Security awareness training 
			programs help to enhance your organization’s security posture and tighten its processes, thereby 
			paving the way to building a more resilient business. Cybersecurity awareness must be an 
			organization-wide initiative for it to be most effective and beneficial.</p>
			<br><br><br><br>
			<h1>Why is cybersecurity awareness important?</h1><br><br>
			<p>Despite having best-in-class defense systems and measures in place, many organizations still 
			experience security breaches. Unfortunately, it is often human error that has been a major 
			contributing factor behind many data breaches. According to Verizon’s 2022 Data Breach 
			Investigations Report, more than 80% of breaches involved the human element, including social 
			engineering attacks, errors and misuse of stolen credentials. Threat actors look to exploit this
			weakness to infiltrate an organization’s networks and systems. This is where cybersecurity 
			awareness comes in.

			Ignoring or not conducting cybersecurity awareness training regularly can have serious 
			consequences on your business such as legal penalties, financial loss and cost of remediation, 
			loss of intellectual property, damaged company reputation, loss of customer trust and so on.
			After all, your company’s cybersecurity strategy is only as strong as your weakest link — your 
			employees.</p><br><br><br>
			<h1>What is cybersecurity awareness training?</h1><br><br>
			<p>With cybercrime continuing its upward trend, cybersecurity is a top priority for businesses of 
			all sizes. Security awareness training is a critical component of an organization’s cybersecurity 
			strategy. It encompasses various tools and techniques used to inform and equip employees about
			security risks and how to avoid them. This helps them understand the cyber-risks your business 
			faces every day, the impact they have on your business and their roles and responsibilities with 
			regard to the safety and security of digital assets.</p><br><br><br><br>
			<h2>What is the purpose of cybersecurity awareness training?</h2>
			<p>Cybercriminals are constantly evolving and devising new methods to exploit vulnerabilities
			to steal valuable data from businesses. Additionally, they look to exploit human behavior and 
			emotions. It is no surprise social engineering attacks like phishing, spear phishing, business
			email compromise (BEC), etc., are so successful.<br>
			<br>Well-educated and trained employees can quickly identify these threats, which can significantly 
			reduce the risk of cybersecurity incidents and help prevent data breaches. Security awareness 
			training not only helps stop threat actors in their tracks, but also promotes an organizational 
			culture that is focused on heightened security. Cybersecurity awareness training is a necessity
			for the survival of your organization. Your organization must invest in cybersecurity training, 
			tools and talent to minimize risk and ensure company-wide data security. A well-defined
			cybersecurity awareness training can help significantly reduce the cost and number of security
			incidents in your organization<br><br></p>
			<h2>What should be included in cybersecurity awareness training?</h2><br>
			<p>Over the years, cybersecurity awareness training has come a long way from being largely 
			reserved for security professionals to include IT administrators and other employees. The scope 
			of cybersecurity awareness programs may vary depending on the number of employees, how aware they 
			are, budget and so on. Regardless of what the scope is, here are some courses that every 
			cybersecurity awareness training program must include.</p><br><br>
			<h3>Email security:</h3><p> Email is one of the most important communications tools for businesses 
			today. However, it is also the entry point for several types of cybercrime, including phishing,
			ransomware, malware and BEC. About 94% of all dangerous ransomware and other malware enter an 
			organization through email. Therefore, email security training is crucial to protect your employees
			and business from malicious email attacks. Email security training will help employees be mindful
			of unsafe links and attachments.</p><br>
			<h3>Phishing and social engineering:</h3><p>The human attack surface is the primary gateway for
			threat actors. Social engineering attackers are aware of how humans think and work. They leverage 
			this knowledge to exploit human behavior and emotions to influence their targets to take desired 
			actions. For example, disclosing sensitive information, granting system access, sharing credentials,
			transferring funds and so on. Verizon’s 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report revealed that more
			than 35% of data breaches involved phishing. Phishing and social engineering attacks are targeted 
			and convincing, making them highly successful. However, with the right training and skills, your
			employees can spot warning signs and greatly reduce the probability of falling victim to these 
			scams.</p><br>
			<h3>Ransomware and malware:</h3><p>Malware, such as ransomware, enters an organization via phishing
			emails. It is estimated that about 300,000 new pieces of malware are created daily. SonicWall’s 
			2021 Cyber Threat Report revealed ransomware attacks increased by a whopping 48% in 2020.
			Ransomware awareness training will help employees understand how these attacks are executed, <br>
			the tactics threat actors use and the actions they can take against rising ransomware attacks.</p>
			<h3>Browser security:</h3><p>Web browsers are hot targets for hackers since they are the gateways 
			to the internet and hold large volumes of sensitive data, including personal information. Not all 
			websites you visit online are safe. Therefore, browser/internet security training, including best 
			practices, browser security tips, the different types of browser threats, internet and social media
			policies, can go a long way toward maintaining confidentiality and browsing the web safely.</p>
			<h3>Password security:</h3><p>According to the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Consumer Sentinel 
			Network, more than 5.7 million cybercrime reports were filed by consumers in 2021, of which 25% were 
			for identity theft. The importance of having a strong password is paramount in today’s threat-laden 
			environment. Security awareness programs must include password management and password best practices,
			including what constitutes a strong password and how to generate one. Your employees must also use 
			multifactor authentication (MFA) whenever possible to prevent account compromises.</p>
